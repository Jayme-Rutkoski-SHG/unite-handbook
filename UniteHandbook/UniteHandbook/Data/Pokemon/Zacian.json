The longer the goal scoring button is held down, the more Aeos energy is charged into the sword, lengthening the duration of the boost effect on basic attacks and moves. This Ability goes on cooldown after it’s triggered. When this Pokémon knocks out or assists (within 4 seconds) in knocking out a Pokémon on the opposing team, that Pokémon will drop an additional 5 more Aeos energy than it normally would. This effect has an 8 second cooldown./n/nMinimum 5 energy is required to charge with a maximum of 10 (except for Unite Move).
