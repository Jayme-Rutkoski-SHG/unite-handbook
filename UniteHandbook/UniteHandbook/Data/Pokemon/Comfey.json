Comfey can have a maximum of eight flowers. Also, Comfey moves 25% faster when near ally Pokémon that are at 50% remaining HP or less. Comfey can attach itself to an ally Pokémon when it uses Synthesis, Floral Healing, or Sweet Kiss, applying a base shield of 15% of Comfey's Max HP./n/nWhile attached, Comfey is unable to be affected by attacks and gradually restores HP. When the ally Pokémon this Pokémon is attached to gains more Aeos energy than the maximum it can hold, Comfey takes the excess. When the ally Pokémon this Pokémon is attached to scores a goal, Comfey also scores with the same amount of energy. If Comfey uses a Move during the scoring charge up, Comfey's portion of the score will be cancelled. Comfey may Release from an ally Pokémon, then moves in the designated direction. If the ally Pokémon attached to was being granted a shield via Triage, the Triage portion of the shield is removed. After this Pokémon releases, its next basic attack becomes a boosted basic attack. Release direction is controlled by Right Stick on Switch and uses the D-Pad's down button on Switch or an individual button for Mobile."
